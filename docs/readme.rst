   An open-source Python package for building Quantum Representations of
   Digital Audio using *Qiskit* circuits.

What is Quantum Audio ?
-----------------------

Quantum Audio refers to standard methods of encoding Digital Audio
Information as Quantum Information, leveraging principles of Quantum
mechanics for Audio Signal Processing. Here, the information is processed 
using quantum bits, or qubits, instead of classical bits (0s and 1s).

New Paradigm
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Audio plays a vital role in carrying information and music, traversing
through domains ‚Äî from **Analog** and **Digital** formats to engaging
our senses in a profound way. With the advent of Quantum Computing,
**Quantum Audio** formulate ways of representing Audio in the Quantum
Domain, enabling new explorations in artistic and research contexts.

The Package
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``quantumaudio`` package provides fundamental operations for
representing audio samples as Quantum States that can be processed on a
Quantum computer (or a Simulator) and played back.

.. code:: python

   quantumaudio.encode(audio)   #returns a quantum circuit
   quantumaudio.decode(circuit) #returns audio samples

Overview 
--------

Modulation Schemes are essential methods for encoding Audio signals in
both Analog (such as **FM**) and Digital (such as **PCM**)
formats. The same is extended for Quantum Audio. The package contains
different schemes to encode audio and necessary utilities.

The following subpackages can be accessed from ``quantumaudio``:

-  ``schemes`` : Quantum Audio Representation Methods

   - **QPAM**: Quantum Probability Amplitude Modulation (Original: `Real-ket <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-015-1208-5>`__)

   - **SQPAM**: Single-Qubit Probability Amplitude Modulation (Original: `FRQI <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11128-010-0177-y>`__)

   - **MSQPAM**: Multi-channel Single-Qubit Probability Amplitude Modulation (Original: `PMQA <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-022-03435-7>`__)

   - **QSM**: Quantum State Modulation (Original: `FRQA <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2017.12.025>`__)

   - **MQSM**: Multi-channel Quantum State Modulation (Original: `QRMA <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-019-2317-3>`__)

-  ``utils`` : Common utilary functions for data processing, analysis,
   circuit preparation, etc.

Additionally, ``tools`` contain extension functions that support basic
visual analysis and audio processing.

ü™Ñ Installation 
----------------

To install the Quantum Audio Package, you can use ``pip`` (included with
Python) which installs it from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/quantumaudio/>`__ package manager. Run
the following command in Terminal or Command Prompt:

.. code:: console

   pip install quantumaudio

For local installation by
`cloning <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`__,
navigate to the cloned directory in Terminal or Command Prompt and run:
``pip install .`` or ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Optional Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All additional dependencies required that support the demos provided in
the repository can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code:: console

   pip install "quantumaudio[demos]"

It includes the following
collection of dependencies also mentioned in the folder
``demos/requirements``:

-  **Digital Audio Dependencies** The core package operates with *numpy*
   arrays. Dependencies for audio file handling to run audio examples in
   notebook and scripts in the repository can be separately installed
   using ``pip install soundfile librosa``


-  **Notebook Dependencies** The `Demo
   Notebook <https://github.com/moth-quantum/quantum-audio/blob/main/demos/demo.ipynb>`__
   features interactive elements that require additional dependency. It
   can be installed using ``pip install ipywidgets``

Usage 
-----

Using Schemes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get started on creating Quantum Audio Representations with just a few
lines of code.

.. code:: python

   # An instance of a scheme can be created using:
   import quantumaudio
   qpam = quantumaudio.load_scheme("qpam") # or directly access from quantumaudio.schemes.QPAM()

   # Define an Input
   original_data = quantumaudio.tools.test_signal() # for a random array of samples (range: -1.0 to 1.0)

   # Encoding
   encoded_circuit = qpam.encode(original_data)

   # ... optionally do some analysis or processing

   # Decoding
   decoded_data  = qpam.decode(encoded_circuit,shots=4000)    


Using Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The core functions are also directly accessible without declaring a
Scheme object. (Refer to `Documentation <>`__ for all the available
functions)

.. code:: python

   circuit = quantumaudio.encode(data, scheme="qpam")
   decoded_data = quantumaudio.decode(circuit)

Here, any remaining arguments can be passed as keywords
e.g.¬†``quantumaudio.encode(data, scheme="qsm", measure="False")``.


Working with Digital Audio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For faster processing of longer arrays, the ``stream`` method is
preferred.

.. code:: python

   quantumaudio.stream(data)

It wraps the functions provided in the module
``quantumaudio.tools.stream`` that help process large arrays as chunks
for efficient handling. Examples of its usage can be found in the
`Demos <https://github.com/moth-quantum/quantum-audio/blob/demos/>`__
provided in the repository.

Running on Native Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Scheme‚Äôs ``decode()`` method uses local
`AerSimulator <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer>`__ as the default
backend. Internally, the function calls ``quantumaudio.utils.execute``
method to perform ``backend.run()`` method. Any Qiskit compatible
backend object can be specified by passing the ``backend=`` parameter to
the ``decode()`` function.

Running on External Quantum Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The package allows flexible use of Quantum Hardware from different
Providers as the execution of circuits can be done independently.
Depending on the results, there are two ways to decode quantum audio:

-  **Results Object:** If the result obtained follow the format of
   `qiskit.result.Result <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Result>`__
   or
   `qiskit.primitives.PrimitiveResult <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.PrimitiveResult>`__,

   -  The audio can be decoded with
      ``scheme.decode_result(result_object)`` method.
   -  In this case, relevant metadata information is automatically
      extracted and applied at decoding. It can also be manually passed
      using ``metadata=`` parameter.

-  **Counts Dictionary:** If the result is in form of a counts
   dictionary or
   `qiskit.result.Counts <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Counts>`__
   object,

   -  The audio can be decoded using
      ``scheme.decode_counts(counts, metadata)`` method.
   -  The metadata dictionary can be accessed from the encoded circuit
      using ``circuit.metadata``.

Using Custom Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``decode`` and ``stream`` operations can be configured with the
following custom functions. They require few mandatory arguments
followed by custom preceding keyword arguments (denoted as
``**kwargs``). - **Process Function**: The default process function of
``stream()`` simply encodes and decodes a chunk of data with default
parameters. It can be overriden by passing a custom function to the
``process_function=`` parameter. The mandatory arguments for the custom
process function are ``data=`` and ``scheme=``.

.. code:: python

   processed_data = process_function(data, scheme, **kwargs)

-  **Execute Function**: The default execute function for ``decode()``
   can be overriden by passing a custom function to the
   ``execute_function=`` parameter. The mandatory argument for the
   custom execute function is ``circuit=``.

.. code:: python

   result = execute_function(circuit, **kwargs)

**Example**: An optional execute function is included in the package
which uses `Sampler
Primitive <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.SamplerV2>`__:
``quantumaudio.utils.execute_with_sampler`` that can be passed to the
``decode()`` method.
