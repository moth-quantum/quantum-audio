     ```bash
     python -m pytest
     ```

7. **Document Your Changes**
   - **Docstrings:** Use Google-style docstrings to document your code. Follow the Google Python Style Guide for consistency:
     ```python
     def function_name(param1, param2):
         """
         Brief description of the function.

         Args:
             param1 (type): Description of param1.
             param2 (type): Description of param2.

         Returns:

         """
         pass
     ```
   - **Update Documentation:** Update the projectâ€™s documentation if your changes affect how the project is used. This may involve editing README files or other documentation files.

8. **Use Linting**
   - **Linting Tool:** We use `ruff` for linting. Ensure that your code adheres to our linting standards.
   - **Ruff Configuration:** Please check our `ruff` configuration [here](.ruff.toml).
   - **Run Linter:** Before submitting your PR, run `ruff` to check for any issues:
     ```bash
     ruff check .
     ```
   - **Fix Issues:** Address any linting issues reported by `ruff`.

9. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages. Follow the commit message guidelines provided in the project (e.g., conventional commits).
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
     ```

10. **Push Your Branch**
   - Push your branch to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

11. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
    - Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository.
    - Provide a clear description of your changes, including any relevant information such as related issues or the rationale behind your changes.
