## üíø What is Quantum Audio ?

Audio plays a vital role in carrying information and music, traversing through domains ‚Äî from analog and digital formats to engaging our senses in a profound way. With the advent of Quantum Computing, we formulate ways of representing Audio Information in the Quantum Domain, enabling new explorations in artistic and research contexts üí´

The Quantum Audio Package provides fundamental operations for representing audio as Quantum States that can be processed on a Quantum computer (or Simulator) and played back in the classical world üîä

## üîç Overview <a id="overview"></a>

Modulation Schemes are essential methods for encoding Audio in both Analog (such as **FM** üìª) and Digital (such as **PCM** üíª) formats. The same is extended for Quantum Audio.
The package contains different schemes to encode audio and necessary utilities as follows:

- ```schemes``` : Quantum Audio Representation Methods

### Key Changes in the Redeveloped Version ```v0.1.0```
This project has been completely redeveloped and is now maintained by <b>Moth Quantum</b>. https://mothquantum.com

- **New Architecture:**

  - This project has been restructured for better flexibility and scalability.
  - Instead of _QuantumAudio_ Instances, the package operates at the level of _Scheme_ Instances that perform encoding and decoding functions independent of the data.
    
- **Feature Updates:**
  
  - Introducing 2 Additional Schemes that can encode and decode Multi-channel Audio.
  - Supports Faster encoding and decoding of long audio files using Batch processing.
    
- **Dependency Change:**
  
  - Support for _Qiskit_ is updated from `v0.22` to `v0.46`
    
- **Improvements:**
  
  - Improved organisation of code for Readability and Modularity
  - Key Information of Original Audio is preserved at Encoding, making the Encoding and Decoding operations independent.
    
- **License Change:**
  
  - The License is updated from **MIT** to **Apache 2.0**

### Migration Guide
If you're transitioning from the previous version, please check the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md) for an overview of the package usability.


##  ü™Ñ Installation <a id="installation"></a>
To install the Quantum Audio Package, you can use ```pip``` (which comes with Python) which installs it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/quantumaudio/) package manager. Run the following command in Terminal or Command Prompt: 
```
pip install quantumaudio
```
For local installation by [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), navigate to the cloned directory in Terminal or Command Prompt and run:<br>
```pip install .``` or  ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>

> [!Note]
 > When using `pip` commands to install packages and dependencies, it's recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep them isolated from the system's Python. This will avoid dependency conflicts especially if you have _Qiskit_ version `1.0` or later installed. Instructions on using a virtual environment are provided [here](ENVIRONMENT.md).

### Optional Dependencies

#### **Digital Audio Dependencies**
  The core package operates with _numpy_ arrays. Dependencies for audio file handling to run audio examples in notebook and scripts in the repository can be additionally installed using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install quantumaudio[audio_io]
  ```
  For local installation from the cloned directory: ```pip install .[audio_io]``` or manually with ```pip install -r requirements-audio.txt```<br>

  > [!Tip]
 > If using your own choice of libraries for digital audio processing, please be aware that Multi-channel Quantum Audio is processed with _Channels First_ data structure. e.g. `(2, N)` for a Stereo Audio of `N` samples.

#### **Notebook Dependencies**
  The [Demo Notebook](DEMO.ipynb) features interactive elements that require additional dependencies. It can be installed using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install quantumaudio[notebook]
  ```
  For local installation from the cloned directory: ```pip install .[notebook]``` or manually with ```pip install -r requirements-notebook.txt``` <br>


## üé® Usage <a id="usage"></a>

Get started on creating Quantum Audio Representations with just a few lines of code.
```python
# An instance of a scheme can be created using:
import quantumaudio
qpam = quantumaudio.schemes.QPAM() # or simply quantumaudio.QPAM()

# Define an Input
original_data = [ ] # an array of samples

# Encoding
encoded_circuit = qpam.encode(original_data)

# ... optionally do some analysis or processing

# Decoding
decoded_data  = qpam.decode(encoded_circuit,shots=4000)    
```
> [!Note]
> The `encode` function returns a circuit with attached classical measurements by default. In Qiskit, it is not possible to directly modify a circuit after these measurements are added. If you wish to return a circuit without measurements, you can specify `measure=False` while encoding.

> [!Tip]
> The circuit depth can grow complex for a long array of samples which is the case with Digital Audio. It is optimal to represent a short length of samples per Circuit. The functions provided in `tools/stream.py` facilitate the processing of Long arrays in chunks. Examples of the usage can be found in the [Demo Notebook](DEMO.ipynb) and `scripts` provided in this repository.

### Running on Simulator

The default ```scheme.decode()``` uses local [_AerSimulator_](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer) as the default backend. Internally, the function performs ```qiskit.execute()``` method similar to ```v0.0.2``` and a compatible backend object can be specified by passing the ```backend=``` parameter.

### Running on Quantum Hardware

The package allows flexible use of Quantum Hardware from different Providers for executing the circuits.

- If the result obtained from a Hardware follow the format of [qiskit.result.Result](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Result) object:
  - The audio can be decoded using ```scheme.decode_result(result_object)``` method. In this case, relevant metadata information is preserved and applied at decoding. 

- If the result is in form of a **Counts** dictionary or [qiskit.result.Counts](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Counts) object with keys representing classical measurement outcomes and values indicating the number of times the outcome was observed:
  - The audio can be decoded using ```scheme.reconstruct_data(counts)``` method. In this case, metadata information can be manually passed as arguments.
 
## üìò Additional Resources <a id="materials"></a>
### Notebook Examples
For examples of circuit preparation, signals reconstruction, and interactive demonstrations, please check the [Demo Notebook](DEMO.ipynb). It combines the core package with useful functions from the `tools` folder to go through Visual and Digital Audio examples.

### Quick Export ‚ö°Ô∏è
To quickly export quantumaudio from any audio file (e.g., mp3, ogg, flac, m4a), a script ```export.py``` is provided in the `scripts` folder. Navigate with `cd scripts` and run:
  ```bash
  python export.py -i path/to/input/audio/file
  ```
  ```console
  usage: export.py [-h] -i [-o] [-v] [--scheme] [--shots] [--sr] [--stereo] [--buffer_size]

  Process quantum audio and export as .wav file.

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -i, --input           Path to the input audio file.
    -o, --output          Path to the output audio file. (default: saves in same directory with a prefix `qa_`)
    -v, --verbose         Enable verbose mode.
    --scheme              Quantum Audio Scheme (default: `qpam` for mono audio, `mqsm` for stereo audio).
    --shots               Number of shots for measurement (default: 8000)
    --sr                  Sample rate of Digital audio (default: 22050)
    --stereo              Enable stereo
    --buffer_size         Length of each audio chunk (default: 256)
  ```

> [!Note]
 > Digital Audio [Dependencies](#installation) must be installed to run this script and it currently uses _AerSimulator_.
