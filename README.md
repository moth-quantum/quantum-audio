An open-source Python package for building Quantum Representations of Digital Audio using _Qiskit_ circuits.

## üíø What is Quantum Audio ?

Audio plays a vital role in carrying information and music, traversing through domains ‚Äî from analog and digital formats to engaging our senses in a profound way. With the advent of Quantum Computing, we formulate ways of representing Audio Information in the Quantum Domain.

The Quantum Audio Package provides fundamental operations for representing audio as Quantum States that can be processed on a Quantum computer (or Simulator) and played back in the classical world üîä

The objective of Quantum Audio is to enable new ways of exploring audio signal processing for artistic and research purposes üí´

## üß© Version Information <a id="version"></a>

### Acknowledgment of Previous Version ```v0.0.2```
This project is derived from research output on quantum representations of audio, carried by <b>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research (ICCMR)</b>, University of Plymouth, UK, namely:

- Itabora√≠, P.V., Miranda, E.R. (2022). Quantum Representations of Sound: From Mechanical Waves to Quantum Circuits. In: Miranda, E.R. (eds) Quantum Computer Music. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-13909-3_10

- Itabora√≠, P. V. (2023) Towards Quantum Computing for Audio and Music Expression. Thesis. University of Plymouth. Available at: https://doi.org/10.24382/5119

### Key Changes in the Redeveloped Version ```v0.1.0```
This project has been completely redeveloped and is now maintained by <b>Moth Quantum</b>. https://mothquantum.com

- **New Architecture:**

  - This project has been restructured for better flexibility and scalability.
  - Instead of _QuantumAudio_ Instances, the package operates at the level of _Scheme_ Instances that performs encoding and decoding functions independent of the data.
    
- **Feature Updates:**
  
  - Introducing 2 Additional Schemes that can encode and decode Multi-channel Audio.
  - Supports Faster encoding and decoding of long audio files using Batch processing.
    
- **Dependency Change:**
  
  - Support for _Qiskit_ is updated from **v0.22** to **v0.46**
    
- **Improvements:**
  
  - Improved organisation of code for Readability and Modularity
  - Key Information of Original Audio is preserved at Encoding, making the Encoding and Decoding operations independent.
    
- **Lisence Change:**
  
  - The Lisence is updated from **MIT** to **Apache 2.0**

### Migration Guide
If you're transitioning from the previous version, please check the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md) for an overview on the package usability.

##  ü™Ñ Installation <a id="installation"></a>
To install Quantum Audio Package, you can use ```pip``` (comes with Python) which installs from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/quantumaudio/) package manager. Run the following command in terminal or command prompt: 
```
pip install quantumaudio
```
For local installation by [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), navigate to the cloned directory in terminal or command prompt and run:<br>
```pip install .``` or  ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>

> [!Note]
 > When using `pip` commands to install packages and dependencies, it's recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep them isolated from the system's Python. This will avoid dependency conflicts especially if you have `Qiskit` version 1.0 or later installed. Instructions on using a virtual environment are provided [here](ENVIRONMENT.md).

### Optional Dependencies

#### **Digital Audio Dependencies**
  The core package operates with numpy arrays. Dependecies for audio file handling to run audio examples in notebook and scripts in the repository, can be additionally installed using pip:
  ```
  pip install quantumaudio[audio_io]
  ```
  For local installation from the cloned directory: ```pip install .[audio_io]``` or manually with ```pip install -r requirements-audio.txt```<br>

  > [!Tip]
 > If using your own choice of libraries for digital audio processing, please be aware that Multi-channel Quantum Audio is processed with _Channels First_ data structure. e.g. `(2, N)` for a Stereo Audio of `N` samples.

#### **Notebook Dependencies**
  The [Demo Notebook](DEMO.ipynb) features interactive elements that requires additional dependencies. It can be installed using pip:
  ```
  pip install quantumaudio[notebook]
  ```
  For local installation from the cloned directory: ```pip install .[notebook]``` or manually with ```pip install -r requirements-notebook.txt``` <br>

## üé® Usage <a id="usage"></a>

Get started on creating Quantum Audio Representations with few lines of code.
```python
# An instance of a scheme can be created using:
import quantumaudio
qpam = quantumaudio.schemes.QPAM() # or simply quantumaudio.QPAM()

# Define an Input
original_data = [ ] # an array of samples

# Encoding
encoded_circuit = qpam.encode(original_data)

# ... optionally do some processing

# Decoding
decoded_data  = qpam.decode(encoded_circuit,shots=4000)    
```

### Running on Simulator

The default ```scheme.decode()``` uses local _AerSimulator_ as default backend. Internally, it performs ```qiskit.execute()``` method similar to ```v0.0.2``` and a compatible backend object can be specified by passing ```backend=``` parameter.

### Running on Quantum Hardware

The package allows flexible use of Quantum Hardware from different Providers for executing the circuits.

- If the results obtained from a Hardware follows the format of [qiskit.result.Result](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Result) object:
  - The audio can be decoded using ```scheme.decode_result(result_object)``` method. In this case, relevant metadata information is preserved and applied at decoding. 

- If the results is in form of counts dictionary or [qiskit.result.Counts](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.result.Counts) object with keys representing classical measurement outcomes and values indicating the number of times the outcome was observed:
  - The audio can be decoded using ```scheme.reconstruct_data(counts)``` method. In this case, metadata information can be manually passed as arguments.
 
## üìò Materials <a id="materials"></a>
### Notebook Examples
For examples on circuit preparation, signals and audio reconstruction, Please try the [Demo Notebook](DEMO.ipynb) 

### Quick Export ‚ö°Ô∏è
To quickly export quantumaudio from any audio file, a script ```export.py``` is provided in scripts folder.
  ```
  python export.py -i path/to/input/audio/file
  ```
  This command will export an output audio file in the same directory. The associated parameters can be controlled by checking ```python export.py --help```<br>
  
  Note: Digital Audio Dependencies (i.e. soundfile and librosa) must be installed to run this script and it only supports AerSimulator currently.
