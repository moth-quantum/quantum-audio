"""This subpackage contains the following utility modules that support the encoding and decoding schemes:

- **data.py**: Data preparation and calculation functions.
- **convert.py**: Data pre-processing functions required for encoding values into the quantum circuit.
- **circuit.py**: Helper functions for quantum audio circuit preparations with Qiskit.
- **qiskit_helpers.py**: Common helper functions for obtaining circuit results and preview information on the circuit. It includes Aer Simulator as the default backend if no backend is specified.
